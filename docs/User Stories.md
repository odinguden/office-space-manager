>[!info] Automatic Reservation
>I am an office worker who does not want to put a lot of effort into things that aren't strictly necessary. I never remember to set my office as being available when I'm working from home, but that is not a big issue with our office manager. Since the office manager is connected to my calendar, and the office mandates we use specific codes to inform management about whether we work from home or not, it will automatically set my office as being available even when I'm not present.
